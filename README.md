# PyGame
pygame exercise to practice OOP.

## Idea

I worked on a basic game with the pygame module to practice object oriented programming a bit.

## Technologies

pycharm
pygame

## workflow

I separated the different stages of the development in different py files to get a clear understanding of how the mini game was built. The final python file is the effects file.
